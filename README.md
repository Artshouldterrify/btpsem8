# AI-Image detection via CNNs and Metaheuristic Algorithms
BTP Semester 8, NSUT. Project-II.
***

This is a repository for all code for the course Project of Semester-8 of group 48, IT of the NSUT batch of '24. This code is written by Stubh Lal (2020UIT3116), Manik (2020UIT3124) and Sippu Utkarsh (2020UIT3137).

This project aims to make a viable AI-generated image detection model using pre-trained CNNs and feature selection via metaheuristic algorithms.
Images of each of the models mentioned in the report can be found in this drive: [drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15lqHhL4YbiWINfZM3rOD8BLtQmXvcwmV?usp=sharing).
