\begin{itemize}
    \item Relevant literature was thoroughly examined and the connections between past research and our problem statement were identified. This enabled us to devise a methodology for expanding upon previous work to achieve our objectives.
    \item We found and used an extensive dataset CIFAKE containing contrasting Real images and fake AI-generated synthetic images. This dataset contains 120,000 images in total with 60,000 images belonging to each class, i.e., Real and Fake.

    \item We used state-of-the-art transfer learning models - ResNet50\_V2, ResNet152\_V2, NASNetLarge, DenseNet121 and MobileNetV3Large with ResNet152\_V2 giving the best results, a testing accuracy of 94.42\%.

    \item We also improved performance metrics using Coral Reef Metaheuristic optimization algorithm for feature selection and achieved accuracy of 97.315\%.

    \item All the theoretical aspects and procedures discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 respectively were successfully demonstrated and their performance results were noted in Chapter 5 hence proving the feasibility and applicability of the proposed work.
