\fontsize{12pt}{24pt}\selectfont {Synthetic image generation has advanced significantly in recent years because of several breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as deep learning with images being generated exhibiting diversity as well as high quality. As a result, it is absolutely necessary to develop a tool that can accurately distinguish between real images and synthetic AI-generated images. The study proposes a framework involving feature extraction from the images of a publicly available dataset CIFAKE by using Convolutional Neural Networks and after comparison of several pre-trained models, we choose the best pre-trained model, ResNet152V2 and after comparison of several metaheuristic optimization algorithms, we select Coral Reef Optimization for feature selection. Following the fine-tuning of the model, the accuracy obtained by this approach was  97.315\% which is better than the recent works on the same dataset.}
